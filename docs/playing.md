# Playing Burnout 3: Takedown

The player's reference: what you need, building by hand, installing each
bundle, the options and the in-game menu, and what to do when something
goes wrong. The [README](../README.md) has the short route; the
developers' side is in [developers.md](developers.md).

## What you need

| Item | Why |
|---|---|
| Your own, legally obtained copy of Burnout 3: Takedown: a disc image (`.iso`) or the extracted folder with `default.xbe` | The game's code and assets come from it. This project does not provide or link to them, and refuses other titles. |
| A build machine: a Mac (Apple silicon), a Linux PC or a Windows PC, with about 15 GB free | The bundle is built from your dump on your machine. A Mac can build every target; Linux and Windows build the Windows and SteamOS bundles. |
| The build wizard, or [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/), git and Python 3.9 or newer | The wizard fetches what it needs itself. By hand, `./burnout3` fetches everything else (CMake, Ninja, the compiler, the toolkit), each download checked against a pinned sha256. |
| A controller (two for split-screen), or the keyboard on a Mac | Pad 1 and pad 2 are players 1 and 2. |

## Platforms

| You play on | Bundle | Graphics | Audio | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Steam Deck, Linux (Proton) | `steamos` (the Windows build, run under Proton through `umu-run`) | Direct3D 11 (DXVK) | XAudio2 (FAudio) | Plays: a scripted race runs at about 57 frames a second on the Deck, the regular test machine. |
| Mac (Apple silicon) | `macos` (`.dmg`) | Metal | SDL3 (CoreAudio) | Plays: the same race runs at about 55 frames a second. The title and menu music is silent. |
| Windows 10 or 11 | `windows` (a setup program) | Direct3D 11 | XAudio2 | Builds and installs; checked to start and reach Press START on Windows 11. Played and tested under Proton. |

The game draws at 640x480 and 4:3, as on the Xbox; a wide window or screen
is pillarboxed, never stretched. The render scale draws it sharper, and a
wide aspect ratio shows more at the sides (see [Options](#options)).

## Build the game

**The short route: the build wizard.** From the first release on, each
[release](https://github.com/apexJCL/burnout3-recomp/releases) has a small
program for Windows, macOS and Linux (Steam Deck included): download yours,
point it at your disc image, pick the options, and it builds and installs
the game for you. It runs the same commands as below, and offers a small
update build for a device that already has one. Windows SmartScreen and
macOS Gatekeeper warn about it (it is not signed): on Windows, More info >
Run anyway; on macOS, right-click > Open once.

**By hand.** Get this project, then go into its folder (in Terminal on macOS
and Linux, or in PowerShell on Windows):

```sh
git clone https://github.com/apexJCL/burnout3-recomp.git
cd burnout3-recomp
./burnout3 /path/to/your/disc.iso
```

In PowerShell that is `.\burnout3 C:\path\to\disc.iso`. On Windows, keep the
path short (`C:\g\burnout3`) and run `git config --global core.longpaths true`
once before the clone.

It checks that the disc is Burnout 3: Takedown, puts its files in
`Burnout 3 Takedown/` in this folder (git ignores it), fetches the toolchain, lifts
the game and builds a bundle for this computer: macos on a Mac, steamos on Linux, windows on Windows.
The first run takes a while; later runs only rebuild what changed. The
bundle lands in `dist/`.

```sh
./burnout3 package windows|steamos|macos   # the same, for another target
./burnout3 doctor      # what this machine has, what it can package, and what to install first
```

Copy the bundle to the machine you play on and install it there:

| Target | Install | Saves, settings and logs |
|---|---|---|
| **Steam Deck / Linux** (`dist/Burnout3Takedown-<v>-steamos.tar`) | In Desktop Mode: `tar -xf Burnout3Takedown-<v>-steamos.tar`, `cd Burnout3Takedown-<v>-steamos`, `./install.sh --steam` (Steam open: it adds "Burnout3Takedown" as a non-Steam game). A stock Deck has no `umu-run`; the installer offers to download it, or run `./install.sh --fetch-umu`. The first launch downloads the Steam Linux Runtime and GE-Proton, which takes a few minutes. Later versions: `./install.sh`; `./install.sh rollback` goes back one. | `~/Games/Burnout3Takedown/{hdd,config,logs}` |
| **macOS** (`dist/Burnout3Takedown-<v>.dmg`) | Open the `.dmg` and drag `Burnout3Takedown.app` to Applications (replace the old one to update). The app is signed ad hoc, not notarized: on another Mac, right-click > Open once, or `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Burnout3Takedown.app`. | `~/Library/Application Support/Burnout3Takedown/{hdd,config,logs}` |
| **Windows** (`dist/Burnout3Takedown-<v>-windows/`) | Keep the folder together and run `Burnout3Takedown-<v>-setup.exe`. It installs for your user only, with a Start Menu entry. SmartScreen will warn (unsigned, built on your machine): More info > Run anyway. | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Burnout3Takedown\{hdd,config,logs}` |

Saves (`hdd/`), settings (`config/`) and logs (`logs/`) live outside the
program files and survive every update, rollback and uninstall.

**Updating to a new release.** Run the new release's wizard on the same build folder, or by hand `git pull` and then `./burnout3` in this folder.

**A bundle is private.** It contains your copy of the game and code generated
from it. Keep it on your own machines; never share, upload or publish it.

## Options

The game reads its options from `config/config.toml` in the data folder
above. `config.default.toml` (beside the executable,
`packaging/config.default.toml` here) lists every key at its default; copy
a line into your `config.toml` to change it, for example `scale = 2` under
`[render]` to draw at 1280x960. The wizard writes the options you pick
there. Defaults that differ from the Xbox:

- `storage.ram_cache = true`: the game's cache partition lives in memory
  (up to 750 MB of RAM) instead of being rewritten on your disk.
  `ram_cache = false` under `[storage]` puts the files back on the disk.
- `present.pacing`: the macOS app sleeps in the game's waits (`"sleep"`,
  which frees a CPU core); the Windows build, on a Deck under Proton too,
  keeps the Xbox's timing (`"spin"`). `pacing = "spin"` or
  `pacing = "sleep"` under `[present]` picks either on any build.
- `present.surface = "auto"`: in SteamOS Game Mode the game hands gamescope
  the frame to scale instead of a window (`"window"` restores that).

### The in-game menu

F10, Guide+A or Back+L3 held 0.4 s (and, on macOS, an Elite controller's
P1) opens a menu over the game to change these options while it runs,
rebind the host actions and turn mods on or off; Save keeps only what you
changed in `config/config.toml`. The game keeps running behind it and sees
no input. F3 toggles a stats strip (fps, frame ms, pacing, scale, backend)
in the window's top right corner. On a Steam Deck, SteamOS keeps Guide+A
for itself: use Back+L3, or bind R4 to F10 once in Steam Input (the game's
controller settings > Back Grip Buttons > R4 > Keyboard > F10).
`[menu] enabled = false` turns the menu off.

## Game modes

Modes, as upstream recorded them:

| Mode | Players | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Race (Single Event) | 1 | plays to the finish |
| Time Attack | 1 | plays |
| Road Rage | 1 | plays |
| Crash | 1 | plays: launch, pile-up, score |
| Race | 2, split-screen | plays |
| Road Rage | 2, split-screen | plays |
| Double Impact | 2, split-screen | plays |
| Team Crush | 2, split-screen | plays |
| Party Crash | 2–8, pass the pad | plays |
| Xbox Live / System Link | — | not attempted |

## Known issues

- The title screen and menu music is silent on the Mac.
- No profile saving, so the tutorial video plays at every start.
- Upstream's list for its toolkit: vertical streaks over the menu backdrop
  movie, seams in the sky dome, and bump-mapped texture stages read as zero.
- Xbox Live and System Link are not attempted.
- On the Steam Deck the game starts in a window: add it to Steam with the
  Gamepad template.

## Troubleshooting

- **The wizard or `./burnout3` says "another release".** Your disc is
  another region or revision than the one in the README's supported version box. The build may fail or the game
  misbehave; see the README's supported version box.
- **macOS: "the app is damaged" or cannot be opened.** Gatekeeper: right-click
  the app and pick Open, once, or `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Burnout3Takedown.app`.
- **Steam Deck: the first launch shows only a notice for a few minutes.**
  It is downloading the Steam Linux Runtime and GE-Proton; the game starts
  when that is done.
- **Windows: SmartScreen warns about the wizard or the setup program.**
  It is not signed: More info > Run anyway.

## Reporting a bug

[Open a bug report](https://github.com/apexJCL/burnout3-recomp/issues/new?template=bug_report.yml) on this repository: the form asks for everything below.
Say which platform and bundle version you run (the version is in the
bundle's name and in `logs/`), what you did, and attach the newest
`logs/game-*.log` and `logs/xbox_kernel.log` from the data folder. Never
attach your game files, a save or the bundle itself. Problems with the wizard or the
`./burnout3` commands themselves go to
[xboxrecomp-cli's issues](https://github.com/apexJCL/xboxrecomp-cli/issues).
